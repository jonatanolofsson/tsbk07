This paper describes the project made by Jonatan Olofsson and Mikael Silvén
in the course \textit{TSBK07 - Computer Graphics} at Linköping University, spring 2012.

The project aimed to create real-time rendered grass, and to demonstrate
and test a few uses of modern GPU algorithms.

Basic ideas and inspiration was taken from a previous Master's Thesis on the
subject of real-time grass rendering\footnote{\url{http://illogictree.com/blog/masters-thesis/}}.
