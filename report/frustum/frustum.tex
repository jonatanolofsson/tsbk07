\section{Frustum}
\label{cha:frustum}
To reduce the computational load, a technique called \textit{frustum culling}
was studied and implemented. The idea is to render only the parts of the
world that are inside the visible frustum.
In this project, the focus of the frustum culling was the terrain and grass.
Since both these are present on the ground level, we can limit the culling
to this plane. By imposing certain restrictions on the orientation of the viewing frustum,
we can map the corners of the frustum-intersecting ground plane to world coordinates.
Since we know the ground plane in world coordinates and the frustum bounding box in
frustum coordinates, we need to solve the multi-dimensional two-point boundary-value problem in \eqref{eq:twopoint}.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:twopoint}
    \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
x_{00} & x_{01} & x_{02} & x_{03} \\
* & * & * & * \\
x_{20} & x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} \\
x_{30} & x_{31} & x_{32} & x_{33}
\end{array}
\right ) =
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
A_{00} & A_{01} & A_{02} & A_{03} \\
A_{10} & A_{11} & A_{12} & A_{13} \\
A_{20} & A_{21} & A_{22} & A_{23} \\
A_{30} & A_{31} & A_{32} & A_{33}
\end{array}
\right )
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
* & * & * & * \\
y_{10} & y_{11} & y_{12} & y_{13} \\
* & * & * & * \\
* & * & * & *
\end{array}
\right )
\end{equation}
The system of equations in \eqref{eq:twopoint} is easily solved numerically,
yielding world coordinates which can be mapped to the terrain, as visualized in Figure \ref{fig:fculling}.

The extracted corners were then used to do a single-dimension sweep in the x-axis; from the leftmost corner of the visible terrain, to the rightmost.
For each x-coordinate, an OpenCL step was applied to extract all the visible indices with that coordinate.
Doing this in OpenGL memory-space ment that a minimal amount of data had to be copied before the
final rendering stage, when a single OpenGL call could render the full visible world, thanks to
the inherent sorting of the OpenCL pre-processing stage.
