\section{Conclusions}
\label{cha:conclusions}
In a project like this, there is always work left to do when the project is due.
Thus, further work would include bugfixes and further optimization of the code as well as
extensions to for instance reduce far away grass to mere textures.

We have however, during the course of the project, demonstrated advanced
real-time rendering of grass, utilizing both an OpenCL pre-processing stage
on the GPU as well as advanced use of the OpenGL shader pipeline.
